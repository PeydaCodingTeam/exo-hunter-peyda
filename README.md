# üåå NASA Exoplanet Predictor
A machine learning web application for classifying potential exoplanets using data from NASA's Kepler and TESS missions. This tool helps astronomers and researchers analyze celestial objects and predict whether they are confirmed exoplanets, candidates, or false positives.

# üöÄ Features

üî≠ Prediction Capabilities
Dual Model System: Separate trained models for Kepler and TESS mission data

Single Prediction: Real-time classification for individual celestial objects

Bulk Processing: CSV batch predictions for large datasets

SHAP Explanations: Model interpretability with feature importance analysis

# üìä Model Information
Kepler Model: Random Forest classifier (92.5% accuracy)

TESS Model: XGBoost multi-class classifier (72% accuracy)

Comprehensive Classification: Distinguishes between confirmed planets, candidates, and various false positive types

# üíæ Data Management
Prediction History: Complete audit trail of all predictions

Search & Filter: Find predictions by model, date, or results

Export Capabilities: Download history as CSV for further analysis

Duplicate Prevention: Smart cleanup of redundant entries

# üõ† How To Run
Install Python 3.11.0 or higher

Go to directory of the project

open terminal

pip install -r requirements.txt

py app.py

Open browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
